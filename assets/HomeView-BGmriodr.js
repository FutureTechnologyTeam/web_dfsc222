The gradual maturity of software design theory and the rapid development and productization of hardware design and implementation provide a good foundation and opportunity for solving the above problems. </span></div></div>',2)]))}const J=c(V,[["render",A],["__scopeId","data-v-b34020dc"]]),q={__name:"HomeView",setup(n){return(e,p)=>(a(),o(l,null,[t(u),t(N),t(J),t(E)],64))}};export{q as default};
