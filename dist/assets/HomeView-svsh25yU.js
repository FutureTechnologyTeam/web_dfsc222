The gradual maturity of software design theory and the rapid development and productization of hardware design and implementation provide a good foundation and opportunity for solving the above problems. </span></div></div>',2)]))}const V=c(H,[["render",U],["__scopeId","data-v-6ab71498"]]),O={__name:"HomeView",setup(n){return(e,p)=>(t(),o(l,null,[a(u),a(B),a(V),a(E)],64))}};export{O as default};
